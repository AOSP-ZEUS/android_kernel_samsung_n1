        help
         If you say yes here you get support for ambient light sensing and
         proximity infrared sensing from Intersil ISL29018.
         This driver will provide the measurements of ambient light intensity
         in lux, proximity infrared sensing and normal infrared sensing.
         Data from sensor is accessible via sysfs.
